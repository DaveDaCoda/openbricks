Patches for MPlayer should be made so that they can be: 

1) Numbered into the following broad groups:

000-049 : uClibC and general compilation-related
050-099 : VESA, VIDIX, VO-related
100-149 : ALSA-related
150-199 : Miscellaneous changes (e.g. filter types etc)
200-249 : input-related
250-299 : bg_video/OSD-related
300-349 : DVD/VCD/CDDA-related
350-399 : subtitle-related
400-449 : encoder/recorder-related
500-649 : libmenu-related
650-699 : tv-related
700-749 : dvdnav-related

2) If possible, patches that are unrelated to the previous patch should
have a numeric spacing of 5 (0,5,10...) so that new patches related to
an existing patch can be inserted in the sequence later if needed.
